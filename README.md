This project is developed by Emmanuel Yirenkyi a student of university for Development Studies as part of the requirement for the award of a bachelor of science degree in information technology.
This project is an analysis and implementation of a computerized system that is going to be used by departments at the University for Development Studies and any other university in general. This is to speed up processes and activities associated with the departments. This system is a windows based application developed under the .NET platform using Visual Basic 2013. This system would help in the registration of staff members, students, associations, assignment of courses to programmes and courses to lecturers. The system would also help to compute studentsâ€™ course grade by computing all available criteria such as assignment, mid-trimester or mid-semester exams and end of trimester or semester exams. Determining the financial status of the department, the system would help to track all income and expenditure transactions and produce report based on any periodic interval. Lastly this software includes an inbuilt E-Voting System that can be used to run elections by the department
